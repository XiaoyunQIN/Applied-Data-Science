**New York City Restaurant Inspection Results**

## Introduction
We analysed New York city restaurant inspection results to learn more about the different types of restaurant violations. We were interested to know more about the process behind the grades given to restaurants.


![](beware.jpeg)


## Description of the Data: 
We got restaurant inspection data for three years from 2016- 2019. The dataset consists of **383k** rows and **18** variables (long format) . Some of the important variables were:

- **CAMIS**: unique id for each restaurant
- **Borough**: "Manhattan", "Bronx", "Queens", "Brooklyn", "State Island"
- **Cuisine**: 84 cuisines
- **Inspection date**
- **Violation discription**: 92 types
- **Critical Flag**: "Not Critical", "Critical", "Not Applicable"
- **Score**: numeric from -1 to 156
- **Grade**: "A", "B", "C", "P", "Not Yet Graded"



## Grading process
On inspection, restaurants are assigned points for each violation the inspector finds. The rules call for assigning 7 for public health violation, 5 for critical violation and 2 for general violation. Based on their score they are assigned a grade. 


![](grade.png)


##Data Cleaning 
Like every dataset, our dataset required data cleaning as well.We took the following steps to prepare the data for analysis. 


- Removed the restaurants that haven't been inspected yet
- Corrected the format of the date
- Regrouped the Violation discription
- Regrouped the cuisine Information
- Investigated and fixed missing values
- Geocoded data with Google API key

##Analysis and Exploration
We explored the data to understand the trends of violations in New York city. Here are some interesting insights from our data set. 


![](data.png)


##Restaurants near Columbia University with the most number of violations in three years

```{r Columbia Critical}


Columbia <- dat[ZIPCODE=="10025" , .(get(restaurant.name),get(borough.name), get(score.name), get(critical.flag.name), get(grade.name), get(violation.content.name)), by = id.name]
colnames(Columbia) <- c(id.name, restaurant.name, borough.name, score.name, critical.flag.name, critical.flag.name, violation.content.name)

Critical <- Columbia[, .("Total Violations"= .N), by = restaurant.name]
colnames(Critical) = c("Restaurant Name", "Total Violations")
setorderv(Critical, cols = "Total Violations", order= -1)

```

##Conclusion and Insights 

- Grade A restaurants could also have critical violations.
- Even there are food inspection system, there are increasing trend on violation scores each year.
- Violation results have seasonal differences, and food inspectors should increase the number of inspections in summer and fall.
- A platform like ours could help inspectors recognise restaurants with more violations; and strict followups can be initiated to such restaurants.
- There are relations among violation types. Improving the cleanliness of food-contact faciliaties might largely reduce all the other types of violations.
